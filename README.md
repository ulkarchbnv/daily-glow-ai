#  DailyGlow – AI-Powered Makeup & Skincare Recommender 🌸

### 👩‍💻 Project Overview
**DailyGlow** is a personalized beauty assistant built with Python and Streamlit.  
It recommends skincare and makeup products based on your **skin type**, **mood**, and **weather** — helping you discover daily routines that fit both your personality and your environment.

This project started as a creative experiment to combine **AI and self-care**, showing how technology can make everyday life more enjoyable and personal.
I wanted to create something that feels warm, friendly, and useful — not just technical. DailyGlow reflects my interest in creative technology, where coding meets design, lifestyle, and well-being.
It is also considered to help teenagers who are new to makeup and have a lot of mood changes :)
